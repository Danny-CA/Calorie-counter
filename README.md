## Introduction
A healthy diet is a challenge today due to the lack of structured information about recipes and their properties. There are numerous scattered resources on the internet, but there is no repository that facilitates the search and analysis of recipes based on specific criteria, such as culinary regions or ingredient combinations.

A digital repository that centralizes recipes from various sources, allowing their analysis and organization, facilitates access to reliable and structured information. This could be used by both professionals and cooking enthusiasts to explore new recipes based on their needs and preferences.

## Justification
The need for an organized and structured digital repository arises from the difficulty in accessing comprehensive and reliable information on recipes. While there are many resources available online, they are often unstructured and difficult to analyze systematically.

A well-designed repository will:

- Enable efficient searching based on various criteria.

- Provide reliable nutritional information for informed decision-making.

- Serve as a tool for both research and culinary exploration.

- Facilitate integration with external data sources to enrich the dataset.

- General Objective

## General Objective

To develop a digital repository that centralizes, organizes, and allows the analysis of recipes from diverse sources, incorporating structured data on ingredients, categories, nutritional values, and origins.

## Particular Objectives
1.- Design and implement a structured database to store recipes, ingredients, nutritional information, and regional classifications.

2.- Develop a web platform using Django to allow users to search and filter recipes based on various criteria.

3.- Ensure data security and privacy by implementing encryption techniques to protect sensitive user information.

4.- Support culinary and nutritional research by providing structured datasets that can be used for scientific and academic studies.
